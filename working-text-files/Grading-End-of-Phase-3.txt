- To pass this project, you must pass each project rubric objective. The project rubric objectives for Phase 3 are:

> 1. ML Communication
> 2. Data Preparation for Machine Learning
> 3. Nonparametric and Ensemble Modeling

1.0: ML Communication

- Recall that communication is one of the key data science "soft skills.

- (def) ML Communication is to Communicate the `performance of` and `insights` generated by machine learning models to diverse audiences via writing, live presentation, and visualization.


- High-quality ML Communication includes `rationale`, `results`, `limitations`, and `recommendations`:

1.0.1: Rationale: Explaining why you are using machine learning rather than a simpler form of data analysis

- What about the problem or data is suitable for this form of analysis?
- For a data science audience, this includes your reasoning for the changes you applied while iterating between models.

1.0.2: Results: Describing the classification metrics

- You can report multiple metrics for a single model, but make sure that indicate a reason for which metrics you are using (and don't try to use all of them at once)
- For a business audience, make sure you connect any metrics to real-world implications. You do not need to get into the details of how the model works.
- For a data science audience, you don't need to explain what a metric is, but make sure you explain why you chose that particular one.

1.0.3: Limitations: Identifying the limitations and/or uncertainty present in your analysis

- Are there certain kinds of records where model performance is worse? If you used this model in production, what kinds of problems might that cause?
- In general, this should be more in-depth for a data science audience and more surface-level for a business audience.


1.0.4: Recommendations: Interpreting the model results and limitations in the context of the business problem

- What should stakeholders do with this information?
